            <p>The Sound Generator is an text & music generator that allows users to create unique,
                algorithmically generated sound. By fetching song lyrics from an online database based on user-selected
                artists and titles, the generator processes the lyrics using N-grams—a probabilistic text generation
                method.
                Then users can input a keyword, and the generator generates new lyrics inspired by the original texts
                while
                incorporating the chosen keyword. Finally, base on the new lyrics, the generator can make a sound for
                users.</p>

            <h2 class="left-title">Fetching Data</h2>
            <div class="right-content">

                <p>The initial goal was to allow users to fetch song lyrics dynamically based on their chosen artist and
                    song titles.
                    I implemented a fetch request to interact with the Lyrics.ovh API. Each song title provided by the
                    user was used to construct an individual API call.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/process 3.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <p>So when the user inputs the correct artist name and song title, the webpage will return the full
                    lyrics of the corresponding song. During the testing phase at this stage, I discovered that the
                    API’s database is not entirely complete, and sometimes data may be missing. However, most popular
                    songs can be successfully fetched.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="second-section">
            <h2 class="left-title">Generating Text</h2>
            <div class="right-content">
                <img src="assets/process 4.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <img src="assets/process 5.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <img src="assets/process 6.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <p>Next, I integrated the fetch function with the N-gram and Markov models introduced in class to
                    deconstruct and analyze the fetched lyrics. This allowed me to use the lyrics as the language model
                    for my text generator. Logically, with this language model, I could generate new lyrics in a similar
                    style.<br>
                    In practice, the class primarily covered text processing based on characters, rather than words. I
                    tested both approaches. The results showed that while word-based text processing produces more
                    logical sentences with significantly fewer errors, it is more suited for handling large datasets.
                    For low-text samples like poems and lyrics, word-based processing creates a sparse language model
                    that struggles to generate coherent sentences. Therefore, I ultimately opted for the character-based
                    (N-gram) approach to process the original lyrics.

                <img src="assets/process 7.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <p>Another observation I made during testing was that the more reference lyrics used, the greater the
                    length and complexity of the generated lyrics. This is due to the inherent logic of how N-grams
                    process text. Simply put, the larger the language model used for sentence generation, the higher the
                    complexity of the generated sentences.</p>

                <img src="assets/process 9.png" alt="示例图片" class="image-content">
                <p>Finally, to enhance the usability of the webpage beyond merely generating text, I added a text editor
                    at the bottom of the page. This editor allows users to save the most recently generated lyrics and
                    make modifications directly. This way, users can continuously generate new lyrics based on different
                    reference songs, compile all the generated lyrics into one place, and edit them to create a fully
                    original, complete set of lyrics.

                <p>Suno AI is an AI-powered music generator that allows users to create unique songs by inputting
                    prompts. I further integrated their official open-source API with my lyrics generator to expand its
                    functionality.</p>

                <p>Once users have finished editing their lyrics, they can use them to generate an actual song. In
                    practice, the edited lyrics serve as the prompt, which is then input into the Suno AI API. Based on
                    this prompt, the API outputs a completely new song for the user.</p>

            <h2 class="left-title">Reflection</h2>
            <div class="right-content">
                <p>In the world of text generation, Structural approaches rely on predefined grammar rules and syntax,
                    which limits creativity and adaptability. They cannot handle unexpected inputs or contexts well. In
                    this case, as language complexity grows, creating comprehensive rules becomes more and more
                    difficult. Besides, the output will lack the nuanced fluidity of natural language.
                    For probabilistic models like N-grams or Markov Models only consider limited context (e.g., the
                    preceding few words),
                    which can result in incoherent or nonsensical sentences. Also, as I said before, the quality depends
                    heavily on the quantity and diversity of training data.
                    Sparse or biased datasets lead to poor outputs.<br>
                    Systematically converting text into data enables the rapid processing of textual information for
                    computation, analysis, training, and text regeneration. However, as demonstrated in this project,
                    the conversion process often results in the loss of nuances such as tone and underlying meaning,
                    leading to an oversimplified interpretation of the text. Moreover, this brief project highlighted
                    that generating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing text from data is far from easy. Understanding
                    the underlying logic of generative text has further deepened my skepticism about the usability and
                    authenticity of such generated outputs.<br>
                    Machines are shaping human language towards a style that prioritizes efficiency, such as through
                    tags, keywords, emojis, and codes. Tools like GPT also contribute to this trend by helping people
                    make their writing more standardized, favoring efficiency over diversity. In this context,
                    aesthetics often becomes the discarded element. From the perspective of language itself, I believe
                    machine-generated language lacks aesthetics because it abandons the complexity and playfulness of
                    text. However, when viewed abstractly from a non-linguistic perspective, these texts take on the
                    characteristics of creative and experimental objects, offering a new form of aesthetic appreciation.
